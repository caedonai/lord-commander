# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Lord Commander Docs

## Documentation Context

This is the documentation site for **Lord Commander CLI SDK**, a comprehensive command-line toolkit for modern web development. The documentation is built with Mintlify and follows these key principles:

### Project Structure
- **Framework**: Mintlify documentation platform
- **Content Format**: MDX (Markdown with JSX components)
- **Navigation**: Defined in `docs.json`
- **Styling**: Mintlify's built-in components and themes

### Content Guidelines

When helping with documentation content:

1. **Use Mintlify Components**: Leverage built-in components like `<Card>`, `<CardGroup>`, `<Accordion>`, `<AccordionGroup>`, `<Tabs>`, `<CodeGroup>`, etc.

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**: 
   - Start with YAML frontmatter (title, description)
   - Use consistent heading hierarchy
   - Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
   - Add cross-references between related sections

3. **Content Structure**:
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "Page Title"
   description: "Clear, concise description for SEO"
   ---
   
   # Main Heading
   
   Brief introduction paragraph.
   
   ## Section Heading
   
   Content with examples and components.
   ```

### Code Examples

Always include realistic, working examples:

```typescript
// Good: Complete, runnable example
import { createCLI } from '@caedonai/lord-commander';

const cli = createCLI({
  name: 'my-cli',
  description: 'My awesome CLI tool',
  commands: [
    {
      name: 'hello',
      description: 'Say hello',
      handler: async () => {
        console.log('Hello, world!');
      }
    }
  ]
});

cli.run();
```

### Navigation Integration

When creating new pages, remember to:
1. Add the page to the appropriate section in `docs.json`
2. Use consistent file naming (kebab-case)
3. Place files in the correct directory structure

### Mintlify-Specific Features

Use these Mintlify components effectively:

- `<Card>` and `<CardGroup>` for feature highlights
- `<Accordion>` for FAQ-style content
- `<Tabs>` for multi-option examples
- `<CodeGroup>` for language-specific code samples
- `<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>` for callouts

### Documentation Sections

The Lord Commander docs are organized as:

1. **Core Concepts** (`/core/`): Fundamental CLI development concepts
2. **Guides** (`/guides/`): Step-by-step tutorials and how-tos
3. **Commands** (`/commands/`): Individual command documentation
4. **Examples** (`/examples/`): Real-world usage examples
5. **API Reference** (`/api-reference/`): Complete API documentation

### Writing Style

- **Tone**: Professional but approachable
- **Audience**: Developers building CLI tools
- **Focus**: Practical, actionable guidance
- **Examples**: Always include working code samples

### Quality Standards

Ensure all content:
- Has proper frontmatter
- Includes relevant examples
- Uses correct Mintlify components
- Links to related sections
- Follows accessibility best practices

## NX Integration

This docs app is integrated with NX workspace. Available commands:
- `pnpx nx run docs:dev` - Start development server
- `pnpx nx run docs:build` - Build documentation
- `pnpx nx run docs:lint` - Check links and accessibility
- `pnpx nx run docs:preview` - Preview built docs

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Page
1. Create MDX file in appropriate directory
2. Add frontmatter with title and description
3. Update `docs.json` navigation
4. Test with `pnpx nx run docs:dev`

### Updating Navigation
Edit `docs.json` and ensure all referenced files exist.

### Code Examples
Use realistic Lord Commander SDK examples that developers can actually run.

Remember: This documentation serves developers who want to build better CLI tools. Focus on practical value and clear examples!
